# IRC-Bot
Start of an IRC Game Bot!

* He connects, and joins #ModernPascal
* He will +o OP known bosses
* He responds to the message .time in the channel (not direct)

More to come tomorrow:
* Added .time as a public message - to basically see the latency from when you enter it to when you get a response.
* Added .cardfaces to return Heart,Diamond,Club and Spade in UTF-8 to make sure it renders correctly.
* Started adding BlackJack, which switches from a public message to private user to bot - to play the game.
** As the game is played, your score as it progresses is shared in the public.
* More games to be added this week
